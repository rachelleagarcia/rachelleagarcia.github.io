In this post, I'll be writing about poisoning name services like LLMNR, and it's predecessor, NBT-NS, used in Active Directory. I'll be going in-depth about how it works, the exploitation, and the different ways to defend against these types of attacks.

## Introduction

Before we start exploitation, I think it's helpful to talk about what LLMNR and NBT-NS are. 

* LLNMR = Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution
* NBT-NS = NetBIOS Name Service

Both LLMNR and NBT-NS are alternative methods of host identification and used when a Windows host can't resolve a hostname using DNS. When this happens, LLMNR will be used first, and it uses neighbouring computers to see if they know the hostname. And if LLMNR fails, NBT-NS is used next.

### How it works

Poisoning the LLNMR or NBT-NS can also be known as a [man-in-the-middle attack](https://www.rapid7.com/fundamentals/man-in-the-middle-attacks/). 

It works by using Responder to listen for any queries on the same network that the other Windows clients are on, and when DNS fails, and the Windows clients use LLMNR requests, the victims hash will show up on the attacker's machine.

The victim's hash shows up on the attacker's machine because when LLMNR or NBT-NS is used to resolve a hostname, any host on the network can reply. And since an attacker can use Responder as a tool, it will poison the request and give the attacker the victim's hashed password.

Now that we know a bit more about what it is and how it works, let's go through the exploitation.

## Exploitation

*As a disclaimer, I created my own Active Directory service (a.k.a home lab) to explain how this exploitation works. To create my own AD service, I used multiple virtual machinesâ€“one with Kali and one with Windows running on Active Directory. Please do not use this exploit to harm others.*

### The Setup

Now, I've slightly introduced you to Responder, this is the tool that we'll be using to poison LLMNR or NBT-NS. Responder was created and is frequently updated by Laurent Gaffie. If you'd like to read more about Responder, here's a link to the GitHub page: 

[Responder - LLMNR/NBT-NS/mDNS Poisoner and NTLMv1/2 Relay](https://github.com/lgandx/Responder)

Another tool we'll be using is Hashcat, this tool will be used to crack the hash to obtain the victim's password. Hashcat should already be preinstalled on Kali Linux, if not, here's the webpage for it:

[Hashcat - Advanced Password Recovery](https://hashcat.net/hashcat/)

Great, once you have the above tools. Let's get started. 

### Responder

In Kali, we'll open Responder by typing in terminal `responder -I eth0 -rdwv` if you're not sure what the options mean, you can always type `-h` so it displays the different options.

When Responder opens, note the Responder IP address **192.168.250.128**.

We'll use the IP address to manually enter it into our "victim's" machine. Though, under a standard penetration test, we would wait for DNS to fail. Since this is an example, we can simply force the connection to see what it looks like.

Next, we can simply copy the IP address, **192.168.250.128**, and enter it into File Explorer.

Once the IP address is entered, in Kali, we should see in Responder that it returned the call and the hashed password for the user.  We can save the hashed password into a file called hash.txt and use Hashcat to crack the password.

### Hashcat

Active Directory uses NTLMv2 for authentication, so when we use Hashcat, we'll want to make sure we're selecting the right method. We can use `grep` to locate the correct one if you're not sure. In this case, it's the third one **NetNLTMv2**.

To use Hashcat, we can type in the Kali terminal:

`hashcat -m 5600 hash.txt rockyou.txt --force`

The **rockyou.txt** file is a file that contains a list of frequently used passwords. This is why it's extremely important to use strong (and long) passwords to prevent these types of attacks from happening in the first place.

Now, let's press enter.

There we go! We can see that the user's password is set to **Password1**, and we can see that it only took two seconds to crack the password--easy peasy.

## Defence Mechanisms

Now that we know how the attack works, the best way to prevent it? Disable LLMNR and NBT-NS! Especially if it's not being used, and if it's not clear yet, please ensure that all users have strong passwords (the longer, the better).
