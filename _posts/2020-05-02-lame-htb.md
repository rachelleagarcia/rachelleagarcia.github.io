<p>Lame was the first box released in Hack The Box (HTB). It's a good box to start with for anyone new to penetration testing since it's a relatively easy and gets you familiar with using Metasploit.</p>

<h2>Hack the box</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Operating System: Linux</li>
	<li>Difficulty: Easy</li>
</ul>

<h2>Information gathering</h2>

<p>As always, let's start with enumeration by using nmap. I like to use:</p>

<p>It can take a while for the nmap scan to complete, but once it's done, here are the results:</p>

<p>Taking a look at the results, the most interesting ports are port 139 and 445 since they are SMB ports and SMB is a common internet file system that is known to have vulnerabilities. We can also see that they are both currently running <i>Samba smbd 3.X - 4.X</i>, so we can take a look in Metasploit to see if we can find any exploits.</p> 

<h2>Threat modelling and vulnerability analysis</h2>

<p>To access Metasploit, we can enter in Terminal:</p>

<code>msfconfig</code>

<p>It takes a few minutes for Metasploit to open. Once it opens, we can search for an exploit that is related to Samba by using Metasploit's search feature:</p>

<code>search samba</code>

<p>From the search results, this one looks promising:</p>

<p>And based on the description, it says:</p>

<p><i>This module exploits a command execution vulnerability in Samba versions 3.0.20 through 3.0.25rc3 when using the non-default "username map script" configuration option. By specifying a username containing shell meta characters, attackers can execute arbitrary commands. No authentication is needed to exploit this vulnerability since this option is used to map usernames prior to authentication!</i></p>

<p>So let's try using it!</p>

<h2>Exploitation</h2>

<p>To use an exploit, we can type in Metasploit:</p>

<code>use exploit/multi/samba/usermap_script</code>


<img src="/images/blog/lame/metasploit.jpg" alt="using metasploit">


<p>Now we need to configure the exploit so we can use it to attack the machine.</p>

<ul>
	<li><code>options</code>: Gives us the visibility on what options we have to configure the exploit.</li>
	<li><code>set rhosts 10.10.10.3</code>: This would be the victim's IP address.</li>
	<li><code>show targets</code>: This is where we select the target's type (e.g. OS) that we're exploiting.</li>
	<li><code>exploit</code>: Running the exploit.</li>
</ul>

<p>That worked! We now have access to the machine.</p>

<p>We can type <code>shell</code> to see if we can gain shell access.</p>

<p>Once we have shell access, we can type in:</p>

<ul>
	<li><code>whoami</code>: Tells us the type of privileges that we have. It looks like we have root access--perfect.</li>
	<li><code>pwd</code>: In other words, print working directory. We can see that we're in the /root folder.</li>
</ul>

<p>Since we have root access, we can locate both the root.txt and user.txt file to win the game. Remember to <code>cat</code> the file once you find it so you can read the contents and enter the flag into HTB.</p>

<p>Congratulations! We now have root access to the box Lame.</p>
