Lame was the first box released in Hack The Box (HTB). It's a good box to start with for anyone new to penetration testing since it's a relatively easy and gets you familiar with using Metasploit.

* Operating System: Linux
* Difficulty: Easy


<h2><a class="header_post" name="enumeration">Enumeration</a></h2>

As always, let's start with enumeration by using nmap. I like to use:

It can take a while for the nmap scan to complete, but once it's done, here are the results:

Taking a look at the results, the most interesting ports are port 139 and 445 since they are SMB ports, and SMB is a common internet file system that is known to have vulnerabilities. We can also see that they are both currently running <i>Samba smbd 3.X - 4.X</i>, so we can take a look in Metasploit to see if we can find any exploits. 

<h2><a class="header_post" name="threatmodelling">Threat Modelling</a></h2>

To access Metasploit, we can enter in Terminal:

`msfconsole`

It takes a few minutes for Metasploit to open. Once it opens, we can search for an exploit that is related to Samba by using Metasploit's search feature:

`search samba`

From the search results, this one looks promising:

And based on the description, it says:

<i>This module exploits a command execution vulnerability in Samba versions 3.0.20 through 3.0.25rc3 when using the non-default "username map script" configuration option. By specifying a username containing shell meta characters, attackers can execute arbitrary commands. No authentication is needed to exploit this vulnerability since this option is used to map usernames prior to authentication!</i>

So let's try using it!

<h2><a class="header_post" name="exploitation">Exploitation</a></h2>

To use an exploit, we can type in Metasploit:

`use exploit/multi/samba/usermap_script`

Now we need to configure the exploit so we can use it to attack the machine.


* `options`: Gives us the visibility on what options we have to configure the exploit.
* `set rhosts 10.10.10.3`: This would be the victim's IP address.
* `show targets`: This is where we select the target's type (e.g. OS) that we're exploiting.
* `exploit`: Running the exploit.


That worked! We now have access to the machine.

We can type `shell` to see if we can gain shell access.

Once we have shell access, we can type in:


* `whoami`: Tells us the type of privileges that we have. It looks like we have root access--perfect.
* `pwd`: In other words, print working directory. We can see that we're in the /root folder.


Since we have root access, we can locate both the root.txt and user.txt file to win the game. Remember to `cat` the file once you find it so you can read the contents and enter the flag into HTB.

Congratulations! We now have root access to the box Lame.
