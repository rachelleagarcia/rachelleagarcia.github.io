		<p>I have always been a curious person. I like to ask questions, to learn as much as I can and find creative ways to solve problems. This curiosity and drive to learn are what led me to find myself in the technology industry.</p>

    <p>With over five years of experience in the technology field, I am currently an <strong>IT Administrator</strong> specializing in security, privacy, and training.</p>

    <p>When I'm not at work, I'm focused on completing the OSCP certification, solving Hack The Box machines, and part of the BugCrowd program.</p>
